<p class="front">
Hello! Did you know that the lights in the BBB Building are programmable?
We have provided an API for the lights to allow people to program them via JavaScript.
This allows us to provide you with a simple simulator to play around with and test your
light controller function, and then push your controller to the strand for all
the world to see when you're done.
</p>

<p class="front">
<span class="label label-info">TLDR</span>
With the click of a button, you can run any of the submitted programs from the <a href="/gallery/">gallery</a>
and view the currently running show via the <a href="/status/">status</a> page.
</p>

<p class="front">
<span class="label label-info">Programmers</span>
Submit your cool programs to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bbbblinken">subreddit</a> and see them displayed in the gallery!
</p>

<h3>Using the API</h3>
<p>
To use our simulator and control the lights, you'll need to include our <a
href="/client.js">client.js</a> library, which
exports Blinken and Bulb objects. You can instantiate it using the <code>new</code>
constructor, giving it an object that contains a title and who wrote this show:
</p>

<div class="indent" style="width:400px">
<pre><b>var b = new Blinken({title: "My Title",
                     author: "My Name"});</b></pre>
</div>

<p>
This object has a <code>run()</code> method, which takes as an argument an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous
function</a> that is called once to <b>initialize</b> the light strand.

This function is expected to return another anonymous function that is
periodically called to <b>update</b> the state of the light strand. This update
function is expected to return the number of milliseconds to wait before the
update function is called again. Both the initializer and update functions are
given a <code>lights</code> object as an argument, which represents the
current state of the light strand. There are 100 lights in our strand (indexed
0-99), and each light can be assigned individual <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a> and brightness
values. These values are expected as floats between 0 and 1.
</p>

<h3>Walkthrough Example</h3>
<p>Confused? Let's walk through a simple example; we'll leave off anonymous
functions for later. Our simple example will alternate the strand between
all red and all green lights.</p>

<p>First, let's define the update function, that will be called every 500
milliseconds to allow us to update the state of the light strand:<p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ewust/7957194.js"></script>
<noscript>
<pre>
// global variable that keeps track of if we are red (true) or green (false)
var strand_red = true;

function update(lights) {

    // Loop over all the lights 
    for (i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
	if (strand_red) {
            // Set red
            lights[i].rgb(1, 0, 0);
	} else {
            // Set green
	    lights[i].rgb(0, 1, 0);
        }
    }
    strand_red = !strand_red;

    // Wait 500 ms until we get called again.
    return 500;
}
</pre>
</noscript>

<p>Now that we have an update function, we need to create an initializer
function. Our initializer will simply set all the lights brightness to full
on. Our initializer must also return a pointer to our update function.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ewust/7957243.js"></script>
<noscript>
<pre>
function initializer(lights) {

    // Set the strand to full brightness
    for (i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
        lights[i].a = 1;
    }

    // Return our update function
    return update;
}
</pre>
</noscript>

<p>Finally, we can create the <code>Blinken</code> object, and pass our
initializer to it:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ewust/7957250.js"></script>
<noscript>
<pre>
var b = new Blinken();
b.run(initializer);
</pre>
</noscript>


<h3>Result</h3>
<p>That's it! As long as we include the <a
href="/client.js">client.js</a> and <a
href="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js">jquery</a> libraries
on the same page as the above JavaScript, we'll see something like this when run in
a browser (feel free to click and drag or use the scroll wheel to zoom in and
out):

<script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/jhalderm/aLgm721f/2/embed/result/"></script>

<p>When we're satisfied with our simulation, simply click the <code>Run on
Stairs</code> button on the simulation page, and then <a
href="/status/">watch it go!</a> Your code may be
queued behind someone if another program is currently running, but the button
will change to tell you the current status of your program.</p>

<p>If you're happy with how it looks on the stairs, feel free to submit it to
the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bbbblinken">BBBBlinken Subreddit</a> for
all to see, and pick your favorites from the list of already submitted
blinkens.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>You can use any JavaScript environment you want, including running it in
your browser locally, but it's easiest to share your code and simulation with
others (and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bbbblinken">subreddit</a>) if
you use a JavaScript pastebin-like site. We recommend <a
href="https://jsbin.com/">jsbin.com</a>, since it allows you to see the console
as one of the panels. The console can be helpful for finding errors in your
program. 
</p>

<p>
To include the JavaScript libraries on jsbin.com, you'll need to include them
with the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the HTML pane, like this:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jhalderm/55e1071d25a8720244efce77c9aa9608.js"></script>
</p>

<p>
JavaScript allows us to do all of the above much more compactly through the
use of anonymous functions. Here's a cleaner, more "functional" version of the
simple red-green blinking demo:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ewust/7957372.js"></script>
<noscript>
<pre>
(new Blinken()).run(function(lights) {
 
    // variable that keeps track of if we are red (true) or green
    // (false)
    var strand_red = true;

    // Set the strand to full brightness
    for (i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
        lights[i].a = 1;
    }
 
    // Return our update function
    return function () {
 
        // Loop over all the lights 
        for (i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
            if (strand_red) {
                // Set red
                lights[i].rgb(1, 0, 0);
            } else {
                // Set green
                lights[i].rgb(0, 1, 0);
            }
        }
        strand_red = !strand_red;
 
        // Wait 500 ms until we get called again.
        return 500;
    };
});
</pre>
</noscript>

of a simple snake program to help inspire additional ideas.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
